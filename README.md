What's up it's your boy Cool Kid Croc here, I spent 3 days coding this in python. It's buggy so don't send feedback. 

Gameloop: You create a character and spawn in The Hub with the goal of escaping via caravan

The Caravan costs 20,000 cats and will lead to a big boss battle so prepare carefully by exploring the game world

Upgrade stats from the marketplace, visit shinobi thieves to get training, go to the brothel with the chance of catching KenSTD!

Buy bounty maps to engage in boss battles which reward more cats and exp.

Explore the wilderness to fight enemies which reward cats and exp. 

Known Bugs: Dying doesn't work, if you die restart terminal. If you don't you'll have your old character at the main menu with negative health and can heal and continue playing. 
in battle invalid option needs to make enemy not attack that turn
change the home name to race.name 
problem at high strength, stats might glitch

HOW TO START: have Python installed on your PC
run main.py through Python
Enjoy! Send feedback to my discord server channel for the game!
