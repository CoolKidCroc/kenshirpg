# KenshiRPG

What's up it's your boy Cool Kid Croc here, I spent 3 days coding this in python.

### Installing and running the game

2. Have Python installed on your PC
3. Run `main.py` through Python

   $ cd wherever/you/put_the/files

   ```
4. Enjoy!

### Playing the game

Gameloop: You create a character and spawn in The Hub with the goal of escaping via caravan

The Caravan costs 20,000 cats and will lead to a big boss battle so prepare carefully by exploring the game world

Upgrade stats from the marketplace, visit shinobi thieves to get training, go to the brothel with the chance of catching KenSTD!

Buy bounty maps to engage in boss battles which reward more cats and exp.

Explore the wilderness to fight enemies which reward cats and exp. 

### Known Issues
 - Dying doesn't work, if you die restart terminal. If you don't you'll have your old character at the 
   main menu with negative health and can heal and continue playing.
 - Problem at high strength, stats might glitch

### Future changes
 - In battle, invalid option needs to make enemy not attack that turn
 - Change the home name to race.name
